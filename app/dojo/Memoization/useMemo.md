# useMemo

### Purpose

`useMemo` is used for memoization, a technique to optimize expensive calculations or operations by caching their results.

### Use Case

When you have a component that re-renders frequently, and you want to prevent the recalculation of a value unless its dependencies change.

### Benefit

It helps in avoiding unnecessary recalculations, reducing the overall computational load and improving the responsiveness of your application.

### Drawback

Memoization comes with a trade-off.

- Excessive usage can lead to memory-related performance issues, and in some cases,
- Overhead of managing the memoized values might outweigh the performance gain.
- Adds excessive syntax for callback definition, so may complicate the code.

### Consideration

Use `useMemo` judiciously for computationally expensive operations, and consider whether the potential memory overhead is acceptable for your specific use case.
