# React Test Your Might Dojo âš›ðŸ¥‹ðŸ’ª
This dojo presents a selection of React challenges around hooks, patterns, and pitfalls. The goal is to make all tests pass by modifying the code of each challenge component. Its recommended to only run the test when you think you got the answer as the tests will revel the solution. Some challenges solutions are more opinionated than others (I left comments to make it clear), so feel free to change the test condition or skip it based on your  approach.



## How to use
 Install dependencies
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

Head to `./app/dojo` and start working on the challenges.

## Running Tests

For your convenience, we have added the following scripts for running tests:

```bash
npm test:script
```
You will be prompted with a list of tests to run. Simply enter the number of the test you wish to run and press enter.

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```
