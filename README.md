# React Test Your Might Dojo âš›ðŸ¥‹ðŸ’ª
This dojo presents a selection of React challenges around hooks, patterns, and pitfalls. The goal is to make all tests pass by modifying the code of each challenge`s component. 
You free to start with any challenge you like.

The Reconciliation challenge set is the only one that can be beneficial to render. You can do so by running `npm run dev` and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## How to use
 Install dependencies
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

Head to `./app/dojo` and start working on the challenges.

## Running Tests

For your convenience, we have added the following scripts for running tests:

```bash
npm test:script
```
You will be prompted with a list of tests to run. Simply enter the number of the test you wish to run and press enter.

To run a specific test by component name:
```bash
npm test [component_name]
```

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```
